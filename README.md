# School_app
This school application is intended to fulfill further objectives:

 1) follow all updates regarding students marks, their belonging to a certain class, homeroom teacher in charge, subjects being studied at this grade;
 
 2) preserve information with making csv reserve copies

Added functional properties:
1) Class Student objects and class Teacher objects as well as objects of a parent class (Human) have an id number. While initializing a Student object or a Teacher object an id number is being created. It is preserved in the container in parent class Human and provides the same logic as in class Human. Ids of students and teachers don`t repeat themselves in ids of Human objects.
